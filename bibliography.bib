  abstract = {Pharmacogenomics is the study of how our genetic structure determines the response to a therapeutic intervention. It is a rapidly growing field that aims to elaborate the genetic basis for differences in drug response between different individuals and to use such genetic information to predict the safety, toxicity, and/or efficacy of drugs in individual patients or groups of patients. Although drug--drug interactions and environmental factors significantly contribute to interindividual variability in drug response, genetic factors (e.g., inherited variability of drug targets, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and/or drug transporters) also appear to have a major impact on drug response and disposition. When a gene variant is associated with a particular drug response in a patient, there is the potential for making clinical decisions based on genetics by adjusting the dosage or choosing a different drug. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), also called SNPs, are the most common type of genetic variation among people. They are basically a substitution of a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome. They occur normally throughout a person's DNA. They occur almost once in every 1000 nucleotides on average, which means there are roughly 4--5 million SNPs in a person's genome. Most SNPs have no effect on health or development. Some of them, however, have proven to be very important in the study of human health, especially in the field of pharmacogenomics. Researchers have found SNPs that may help predict an individual's response to certain drugs, susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, and risk of developing particular diseases. Scientists assess gene variants affecting an individual's drug response the same way they assess gene variants associated with diseases: by identifying genetic loci associated with known drug responses, and then testing individuals whose response is unknown. SNPs account for the most common genetic differences from person to person and pharmacogenomics explores how such changes in genetic makeup effect drug responses, resistance, etc., With our literature review, we aim to study some of the effects of these SNPs on drug responses in patients. The purpose of the study was to understand and implicate the effects of SNPs in modern medicine and how it can be applied to personalize health care for every patient. A systematic literature search was carried in search of studies pertaining to personalized medicine and implications of SNPs. A thorough search through PubMed, Google Scholar, and ProQuest revealed 61 relevant studies. All study types were considered eligible. Over the past 10 years, tremendous progress has been made in cataloging human sequence variations since this high-density map can offer the required tools to develop genetically based diagnostic and therapeutic tests. When additional functional polymorphisms are known, it may be attainable to develop helpful genetic markers also as personalized medicines. In the future, the main aim is to use SNPs not only to find certain aspects to be used in the future (individualized drug therapy, development of genome-based diets, etc.) but to also unveil the details of genome evolution. A number of challenges exist today in realizing the value of a high-density map of anonymous SNPs for pharmacogenomics. Concerns about the high price of genotyping are being addressed; however, it may be several years before the price of genotyping large populations is acceptable. In addition, availability of large patient populations will be crucial for discovering and validating SNPs.},

  abstract = {Purpose/Background: Multiple meta-analyses have suggested that pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing may be a valuable tool to improve clinical outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have failed at least one treatment. However, these meta-analyses included studies with different PGx tests and different trial designs, which produce uncertainty when interpreting results. To investigate the clinical utility of a single weighted multigene PGx test, a meta-analysis was performed for prospective studies utilizing this PGx test in adult patients with MDD. Methods/Procedures: MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane [including Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)] were searched through May 2025 for studies evaluating the impact of pharmacogenomic testing on outcomes for patients with MDD. Using PRISMA guidelines, 243 records were identified, and 6 studies were included that compared PGx-guided care to unguided care in adult patients with MDD, using a single weighted multigene test. Findings/Results: Overall, 3,532 patients were included, with outcomes evaluated at week 8 or week 10. Patients with MDD whose care was guided by the weighted multigene PGx test were 30\% more likely to achieve response [relative risk ratio (RR)=1.30, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.47, P{$<$}0.001] and 41\% more likely to achieve remission [RR=1.41, 95\% CI: 1.19-1.66, P{$<$}0.001] compared to unguided care. No heterogeneity in outcomes across studies was detected. Implications/Conclusions: Prescribing informed by a weighted multigene PGx test significantly improved response and remission rates among adult patients with MDD who experienced at least 1 prior treatment failure, further demonstrating the clinical utility of weighted multigene PGx testing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The implementation of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in psychiatry remains modest, in part due to divergent perceptions of the quality and completeness of the evidence base and diverse perspectives on the clinical utility of PGx testing among psychiatrists and other healthcare providers. Recognizing the current lack of consensus within the field, the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics assembled a group of experts to conduct a narrative synthesis of the PGx literature, prescribing guidelines, and product labels related to psychotropic medications as well as the key considerations and limitations related to the use of PGx testing in psychiatry. The group concluded that to inform medication selection and dosing of several commonly-used antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, current published evidence, prescribing guidelines, and product labels support the use of PGx testing for 2 cytochrome P450 genes (\emph{CYP2D6, CYP2C19}). In addition, the evidence supports testing for human leukocyte antigen genes when using the mood stabilizers carbamazepine (\emph{HLA-A and HLA-B}), oxcarbazepine (\emph{HLA-B}), and phenytoin (CYP2C9, HLA-B). For valproate, screening for variants in certain genes (\emph{POLG, OTC, CSP1}) is recommended when a mitochondrial disorder or a urea cycle disorder is suspected. Although barriers to implementing PGx testing remain to be fully resolved, the current trajectory of discovery and innovation in the field suggests these barriers will be overcome and testing will become an important tool in psychiatry.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Both genes' genotypes are translated into predicted normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM). Evidence-based dose recommendations were obtained, based on a structured analysis of published literature. In CYP2C19 PM patients, escitalopram dose should not exceed 50\% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 75\% of the normal maximum dose. Escitalopram should be avoided in UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, citalopram dose should not exceed 50\% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 70\% (65--75\%) of the normal maximum dose. In contrast to escitalopram, no action is needed for CYP2C19 UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, sertraline dose should not exceed 37.5\% of the normal maximum dose. No action is needed for CYP2C19 IM and UM patients. In CYP2D6 UM patients, paroxetine should be avoided. No action is needed for CYP2D6 PM and IM patients. In addition, no action is needed for the other gene-drug combinations. Clinical effects (increase in adverse events or decrease in efficacy) were lacking for these other gene-drug combinations. DPWG classifies CYP2C19 genotyping before the start of escitalopram, citalopram, and sertraline, and CYP2D6 genotyping before the start of paroxetine as ``potentially beneficial'' for toxicity/effectivity predictions. This indicates that genotyping prior to treatment can be considered on an individual patient basis.},

Given the potential implications of these outcomes and recent proliferation of PGx studies, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of PGx testing on clinical outcomes in patients with MDD as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL were searched for English-language articles from 2000 to 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGx-guided treatment vs. TAU in patients with MDD. Meta-analyses were conducted in R. Ten RCTs were included: eight reported remission and seven reported response. The best available evidence suggests that PGx-guided care for moderate-to-severe adult depression is more likely to result in remission and response than TAU (both risk ratios significant). However, there are limitations in the evidence base, including high risk of bias and inconsistency between trials. Despite the consequent very low certainty in the magnitude of effect, there is confidence in the direction. Though modest, the beneficial effects of PGx for adults with moderate-severe MDD could - as a result of the scope and scale of the condition and its impacts - have important ramifications for patients and the health system.},

  abstract = {Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, including major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bulimia. Amitriptyline also has different off-label uses, including migraine prevention, neuropathic pain management, fibromyalgia, and enuresis (bedwetting) (1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) primarily mediate their therapeutic effect by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, leaving more neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft stimulating the neuron. Given that the tricyclics can also block different receptors (H1 histamine, {$\alpha$}1-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors), side effects are common. As such, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have largely replaced the use of TCAs; however, TCAs still have an important use in specific types of depression and other conditions. Amitriptyline is metabolized mainly via CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 pathways. Metabolism by CYP2C19 results in active metabolites, including nortriptyline, which is also a tricyclic antidepressant. Metabolism catalyzed by CYP2D6 results in the formation of the less active 10-hydroxy metabolite. Both the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes are highly polymorphic, resulting in proteins with different enzyme activity or expression levels. Individuals who are CYP2D6 ``ultrarapid metabolizers'' (UM) have more than 2 normal function alleles (multiple copies), whereas CYP2C19 UM have 2 increased function alleles. Individuals who are CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 ``poor metabolizers'' (PM) have 2 no function alleles for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. The FDA-approved drug label for amitriptyline states that CYP2D6 PM have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants when given usual doses. The FDA recommendations also include monitoring tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels whenever a tricyclic antidepressant is co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Table 1) (1). The Dutch Pharmacogenetic Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) have issued recommendations for altered dosing based on CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (Table 2) (2, 3). Individuals who are CYP2D6 UM may require up to 1.6 times the normal dose, though cardiac toxicity risk may indicate use of an antidepressant that is less dependent upon CYP2D6 metabolism, such as citalopram or sertraline. Dose reductions are recommended for CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (IM) individuals (75\% of normal dose) and CYP2D6 PM individuals (60\% of normal dose), along with monitoring for side effects and plasma drug levels. (3). The DPWG does not recommend any changes in dosing based on CYP2C19 metabolizer status, since the combined dose of amitriptyline and the active metabolite nortriptyline are not significantly impacted. (2) In 2016, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) published dosing recommendations for tricyclic antidepressants based on CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 metabolizer status, either individually or in combination (Table 3, Table 4) (4). For CYP2D6 UM, CPIC recommends avoiding the use of a tricyclic due to the potential lack of efficacy, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2D6. If a TCA is still warranted, CPIC recommends considering titrating the TCA to a higher target dose (compared with CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, ``NM'') and using therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments. For CYP2D6 IM, CPIC recommends considering a 25\% reduction of the starting dose, and for CYP2D6 PM, to avoid the use of tricyclics because of the potential for side effects. If a tricyclic is still warranted for CYP2D6 PM, CPIC recommends considering a 50\% reduction of the starting dose while monitoring drug plasma concentrations to avoid side effects. For CYP2C19 UM, CPIC recommends avoiding the use of tertiary amines (for example, amitriptyline) due to the potential for a sub-optimal response, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19, such as the secondary amines nortriptyline or desipramine. For CYP2C19 PMs, CPIC recommends avoiding tertiary amine use due to the potential for sub-optimal response, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19. If a tertiary amine is still warranted for CYP2C19 PMs, CPIC recommends considering a 50\% reduction of the starting dose while monitoring drug plasma concentrations to avoid side effects (4). For gene-based dosing of TCAs for neuropathic pain, where the initial doses are lower, CPIC does not recommend dose modifications for PMs or IMs (either CYP2D6 or CYP2C19). For CYP2D6 UM individuals, CPIC optionally recommends considering an alternative medication due to a higher risk of therapeutic failure of TCAs for neuropathic pain (4).},

We analyzed, with a repeated-measure ANOVA, the changes between the baseline and a 6 month follow-up of the efficacy index assessed through the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, and depressive symptoms through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The PGT sample included 53 patients (26 BD and 27 MDD), and the TAU group included 52 patients (31 BD and 21 MDD). We found a significant within-subject effect of treatment time on symptoms and efficacy index for the whole sample, with significant improvements in the efficacy index (F = 8.544; partial {$\eta^2$} = 0.077, p {$<$} 0.004) and clinical global impression of severity of illness (F = 6.818; partial {$\eta^2$} = 0.062, p {$<$} 0.01) in the PGT vs. the TAU group. We also found a significantly better follow-up response ({$\chi^2$} = 5.479; p = 0.019) and remission ({$\chi^2$} = 10.351; p = 0.001) rates in the PGT vs. the TAU group. PGT may be an important option for the long-term treatment of patients with TRD affected by mood disorders, providing information that can better define drug treatment strategies and increase therapeutic improvement.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIn patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), achieving remission and/or response may take many months because of the lengthy trial-and-error process often needed to identify effective medication. Pharmacogenomic testing is a prescribing tool that has been shown to improve remission and response rates for MDD patients, but data describing its impact over time is limited. The objective of this study was to determine whether pharmacogenomic-guided treatment increases the rate of remission and response over time in patients with MDD, and if so, to assess the persistence of that effect.MethodsThis study was a prespecified post hoc analysis of the PRIME Care (Precision Medicine in Mental Healthcare) randomized clinical trial, a pragmatic trial that compared pharmacogenomic-guided treatment with usual care among veterans with depression. Participants were recruited at 22 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers by 676 clinicians and were randomized to the pharmacogenomic-guided arm or the usual care arm. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between study arm (pharmacogenomic-guided treatment or usual care) and the first instance of response or remission as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale.Results1,764 (90.7\%) of the 1,944 veterans who participated in the PRIME Care trial had sufficient visit data to be included in this analysis. Patients who received pharmacogenomic-guided treatment had higher rates of remission (HR [95\% CI] = 1.27 [1.05, 1.53]; p = 0.015) and response (HR [95\% CI] = 1.21 [1.05, 1.40]; p = 0.010) at any time relative to patients receiving usual care. Schoenfeld residuals tests were not statistically significant for remission (p = 0.931) or response (p = 0.112), providing no evidence that the benefit due to pharmacogenomic-guided treatment changed over the 24-week period.ConclusionPharmacogenomic-guided treatment led to faster initial remission and response in patients with MDD, and this benefit persisted over 6 months with no evidence of changing over time.},

J Intern Med 2001; 250: 186--200. Drug treatment is in many cases ineffective. Besides patients who do not respond to the treatment despite receiving expensive drugs, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as a consequence of the treatment, is estimated to cost the US society 100 billion USD and over 100 000 deaths per year. Pharmacogenetics is the discipline which takes the patient's genetic information of drug transporters, drug metabolizing enzymes and drug receptors into account to allow for an individualized drug therapy leading to optimal choice and dose of the drugs in question. It is believed that much cost for the society can be saved in this manner. Many drug transporters are polymorphic. In addition, the majority of phase I and phase II dependent drug metabolism is carried out by polymorphic enzymes which can cause abolished, quantitatively or qualitatively altered or enhanced drug metabolism. Stable duplication, multiduplication or amplification of active genes, most likely in response to dietary components that have resulted in a selection of alleles with multiple noninducible genes, has been described. Several examples exist where subjects carrying certain alleles suffer from a lack of drug efficacy because of ultrarapid metabolism caused by multiple genes or by induction of gene expression, or, alternatively, adverse effects from the drug treatment as a result of the presence of defective alleles. The information about the role of polymorphic drug receptors for efficiency of drug therapy is more scarce, although promising examples are seen in drug treatment of asthma where the efficiency can be severely enhanced by predictive genotyping of the drug targets. In addition, certain polymorphic genes can be used as markers for optimization of the drug therapy. It is likely that predictive genotyping is of benefit in 10--20\% of drug treatment and thereby allows for prevention of causalities as a cause of ADRs and thus improves the health for a significant fraction of the patients. In 15--40\% of the cases, the penetrance of genetic polymorphism is of less importance because of the polygenic influence on the outcome of drug treatment and in 50\% of the cases, pharmacogenetics would be without influence because of other more important physiological and environmental factors. In the present contribution an overview about our present knowledge how polymorphic genes can influence the drug efficacy is presented. Some emphasis will be given to different forms of cytochrome P450 which are of importance for drug metabolism.},

Using cases recruited from the Understanding Drug Reactions Using Genomic Sequencing (UDRUGS) study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of genotyping CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in antidepressant response. Genomic and clinical data for patients who were prescribed antidepressants for mental health disorders, and experienced adverse reactions (ADRs) or ineffectiveness, were extracted for analysis. Genotype-inferred phenotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 was carried out as per Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines. A total of 52 patients, predominantly New Zealand Europeans (85\%) with a median age (range) of 36 years (15-73), were eligible for analysis. Thirty-one (60\%) reported ADRs, 11 (21\%) ineffectiveness, and 10 (19\%) reported both. There were 19 CYP2C19 NMs, 15 IMs, 16 RMs, one PM and one UM. For CYP2D6, there were 22 NMs, 22 IMs, four PMs, three UMs, and one indeterminate. CPIC assigned a level to each gene-drug pair based on curated genotype-to-phenotype evidence. We analyzed a subgroup of 45 cases, inclusive of response type (ADRs/ineffectiveness). Seventy-nine (N = 37 for CYP2D6, N = 42 for CYP2C19) gene-drug/antidepressant-response pairs with CPIC evidence levels of A, A/B, or B were identified. Pairs were assigned as 'actionable' if the CYP phenotypes potentially contributed to the observed response. We observed actionability in 41\% (15/37) of CYP2D6-antidepressant-response pairs and 36\% (15/42) of CYP2C19-antidepressant-response pairs. In this cohort, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes were actionable for a total of 38\% pairs, consisting of 48\% in relation to ADRs and 21\% in relation to drug ineffectiveness.},

Despite its popularity, its exact meaning, and how it is different from other popular terms such as ``stratified medicine'', ``targeted therapy'' or ``deep phenotyping'' remains unclear.

  abstract = {Pharmacogenetics (PGx) holds promise to help optimize the use of psychotropic medications, with CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 emerging as clinically relevant genes in antidepressant treatment. However, there are currently very few studies investigating the genetic variants of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in a population of patients experiencing either ineffectiveness or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antidepressants in real-world settings, i.e., longitudinally regardless of the treatment indication.In our psychiatry department, PGx testing is now available in clinical practice to help with prescribing antidepressants properly, predicting the right dose and improving treatment outcomes. We present a case series involving 40 patients (82.5\% of European origin) who underwent PGx testing due to ineffectiveness or ADRs to antidepressant treatment between June 2020 and April 2022. We describe their demographic, clinical and genetic features and we have assessed the value of PGx testing by consulting the treating psychiatrists.Among the 40 patients, the most common primary diagnoses were major depressive disorder (60.0\%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (30.0\%). Ineffectiveness alone was reported by 26 patients (65.0\%), 1 patient (2.5\%) reported only ADRs while 13 (32.5\%) reported both ADRs and ineffectiveness. Antidepressant classes represented in this study were SSRIs (45.0\%), SNRIs (27.5\%), atypical antidepressants (20.0\%) and tricyclic antidepressants (17.5\%). Only 7 out of 40 patients (17.5\%) had normal metabolic activity for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.We identified 50 CYP2D6/CYP2C19-antidepressant-response pairs, deemed 'actionable' if the CYP phenotypes potentially contributed to the observed response. We found actionability in 11.5\% of CYP2D6-antidepressant-response pairs and 33.3\% of CYP2C19-antidepressant-response pairs. In our cohort, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes were actionable for a total of 22.0\% pairs. The PGx algorithm recommendations were followed in 92.7\% of cases. According to practitioners, 71.4\% of patients showed a considerable decrease ({$\geq$} 3/5) of ADRs and 79.5\% showed a considerable improvement in efficacy ({$\geq$} 3/5).Although the limited sample size invites caution, our findings suggest that patients experiencing ADRs or ineffectiveness to antidepressants exhibit a relatively high prevalence of genetic variants in pharmacogenes known to influence the pharmacokinetics of these medications. The widespread adoption of targeted use of PGx testing in Psychiatry departments could prove beneficial in guiding prescribing decisions.},

  abstract = {The STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) study used a series of sequenced, randomized treatment trials following a first and, if needed, subsequent treatment steps to define the tolerability and effectiveness of various options in both acute and longer term treatment. Adult outpatients (n=4041) with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder, substantial chronic and recurrent depression, and co-morbid psychiatric and general medical conditions were enrolled in 41 representative primary and specialty care settings. About one-third of participants remitted in first step treatment with citalopram, 50\% of these within 6 weeks. Poorer outcomes were associated with minority status, socioeconomic disadvantage, more axis I and III co-morbid disorders, lower function and quality of life, and anxious and melancholic features. In step 2 medication switch, there were no significant differences in remission among within-class, out-of-class or dual-action agents: sertraline (27\%), bupropion-sustained release (26\%) and venlafaxine-extended release (25\%). In step 2 medication augmentation of citalopram, there was no significant difference in remission between bupropion-sustained release (39\%) and buspirone (33\%), although participants using bupropion-sustained release had greater symptom reduction and better tolerability. There were no significant differences in remission in step 2 between cognitive therapy and medication treatment in either the switch (31\% vs 27\%) or augmentation (31\% vs 33\%) strategies, although participants in cognitive therapy augmentation had a longer time to remission than those in medication augmentation (55 vs 40 days). In step 3, there were no differences in remission between a switch to mirtazapine (8\%) or nortriptyline (12\%), or between augmentation with lithium (13\%) or T(3) (triiodothyronine, liothyronine) [25\%], although more participants discontinued lithium due to adverse effects than discontinued T(3). In the fourth step, there was no difference in remission between tranylcypromine (14\%) or venlafaxine-extended release plus mirtazapine (16\%), although the combination treatment had fewer adverse effects and had the advantages of not requiring a washout period or diet restrictions. Participants requiring more than two well delivered treatments may be characterized as treatment resistant given the substantially lower remission rates after that point. Treatment resistance was associated with more concurrent axis I or III co-morbid conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, chronicity and melancholic or anxious features. However, if participants remained in treatment for up to four steps, about 67\% reached remission. Times to remission were not substantially longer for later treatment steps. The importance of reaching remission is highlighted by the lower relapse rates in naturalistic follow-up for participants entering in remission compared with those entering with response but not remission (step 1: 34\% vs 59\%; step 2: 47\% vs 68\%; step 3: 42\% vs 76\%; step 4: 50\% vs 83\%). Clinical decision making based on the itemized measurement of symptoms and adverse effects at each treatment visit was feasible in STAR*D's real world settings and resulted in adequate dosages and durations of treatment that generally exceeded those typically found in practice settings. Although switch and augmentation strategies could not be directly compared due to the equipoise stratified randomized design, the higher remission rates at step 2 with medication augmentation are intriguing and merit further study.},

  abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the simplest form of DNA variation among individuals. These simple changes can be of transition or transversion type and they occur throughout the genome at a frequency of about one in 1,000 bp. They may be responsible for the diversity among individuals, genome evolution, the most common familial traits such as curly hair, interindividual differences in drug response, and complex and common diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and psychiatric disorders. SNPs may change the encoded amino acids (nonsynonymous) or can be silent (synonymous) or simply occur in the noncoding regions. They may influence promoter activity (gene expression), messenger RNA (mRNA) conformation (stability), and subcellular localization of mRNAs and/or proteins and hence may produce disease. Therefore, identification of numerous variations in genes and analysis of their effects may lead to a better understanding of their impact on gene function and health of an individual. This improved knowledge may provide a starting point for the development of new, useful SNP markers for medical testing and a safer individualized medication to treat the most common devastating disorders. This will revolutionize the medical field in the future. To illustrate the effect of SNPs on gene function and phenotype, this minireview focuses on evidences revealing the impact of SNPs on the development and progression of three human eye disorders (Norrie disease, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity) that have overlapping clinical manifestations.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The antidepressant escitalopram (S-CIT) is metabolized by the cytochrome-P450 (CYP) enzymes CYP 2D6, 2C19 and 3A4. This study evaluated the impact of CYP2D6, 2C19 and 3A4 genetic polymorphisms on plasma concentrations of S-CIT and patient treatment response. MATERIALS \& METHODS: A total of 100 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder were recruited to the study and their depression symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The genetic polymorphisms *4, *5 and *10 on CYP2D6, *2, *3 and *17 on CYP2C19, and *18 on CYP3A4 were selected based on their function and respective allele frequencies in Asian populations. Polymorphisms were analyzed using the SNPstream genotyping system, PCR and direct sequencing methods. The steady-state serum concentrations of S-CIT and its metabolites S-desmethylcitalopram and S-didesmethylcitalopram were analyzed by HPLC. According to semiquantitative gene dose (SGD) and gene dose (GD) models for allele combinations of these polymorphisms, CYP2D6 was clustered into intermediate (0.5, 1 and 1.5 SGD) and extensive (2 SGD) metabolizers, while CYP2C19 was clustered into poor (0 GD) and extensive (1 and 2 GDs) metabolizers. RESULTS: The group of patients with intermediate CYP2D6 metabolism (0.5 SGD) had a significantly higher frequency of remitters from major depressive disorder during the 8-week treatment (p = 0.0001). Furthermore, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had significantly higher S-CIT serum levels than did extensive metabolizers at weeks 2, 4 and 8 (p {$<$} 0.05). The allele frequencies in CYP3A4*18 and CYP2C19*17 were too low to permit further subgroup analyses. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 may be influencing S-CIT serum concentrations, and that specific CYP2D6 polymorphisms may be predicting patient treatment outcomes based on gene dosage analyses.},

  abstract = {Few new psychiatric drugs have entered the market in recent decades; in contrast, the number of drugs carrying pharmacogenomic labels continues to increase. For the foreseeable future, the advancement of psychiatry and drug therapy may hinge on personalized treatment. Currently, antipsychotic or antidepressant choices rely heavily on the clinical experience of psychiatrists and potentially lengthy iterative trials. During these trials, the clinical response to treatment in acutely depressed patients can be assessed only after several weeks of exposure to the drug. Although pharmacogenomic testing has been used in clinical care for several years, most Chinese clinicians struggle to utilize the information accurately, resulting in expensive tests that provide little real benefit to patients. Here, we demonstrate how to combine the results of pharmacogenomic testing to develop an individualized treatment plan. Our goal is to find the optimal medication regimen and dosage for the patient in the shortest possible time, control symptoms as soon as possible, and predict adverse drug reactions. This approach aims to offer a practical therapeutic idea for clinical practice.},
