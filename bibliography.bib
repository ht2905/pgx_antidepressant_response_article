  abstract = {Purpose/Background: Multiple meta-analyses have suggested that pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing may be a valuable tool to improve clinical outcomes for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have failed at least one treatment. However, these meta-analyses included studies with different PGx tests and different trial designs, which produce uncertainty when interpreting results. To investigate the clinical utility of a single weighted multigene PGx test, a meta-analysis was performed for prospective studies utilizing this PGx test in adult patients with MDD. Methods/Procedures: MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane [including Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)] were searched through May 2025 for studies evaluating the impact of pharmacogenomic testing on outcomes for patients with MDD. Using PRISMA guidelines, 243 records were identified, and 6 studies were included that compared PGx-guided care to unguided care in adult patients with MDD, using a single weighted multigene test. Findings/Results: Overall, 3,532 patients were included, with outcomes evaluated at week 8 or week 10. Patients with MDD whose care was guided by the weighted multigene PGx test were 30\% more likely to achieve response [relative risk ratio (RR)=1.30, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.47, P{$<$}0.001] and 41\% more likely to achieve remission [RR=1.41, 95\% CI: 1.19-1.66, P{$<$}0.001] compared to unguided care. No heterogeneity in outcomes across studies was detected. Implications/Conclusions: Prescribing informed by a weighted multigene PGx test significantly improved response and remission rates among adult patients with MDD who experienced at least 1 prior treatment failure, further demonstrating the clinical utility of weighted multigene PGx testing.},

Genetic variation in CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 influences the metabolism of many of these antidepressants, which may potentially affect dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. In addition, the pharmacodynamic genes SLC6A4 (serotonin transporter) and HTR2A (serotonin-2A receptor) have been examined in relation to efficacy and side effect profiles of these drugs. This guideline updates and expands the 2015 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes and SSRI dosing and summarizes the impact of CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, SLC6A4, and HTR2A genotypes on antidepressant dosing, efficacy, and tolerability. We provide recommendations for using CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 genotype results to help inform prescribing these antidepressants and describe the existing data for SLC6A4 and HTR2A, which do not support their clinical use in antidepressant prescribing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The implementation of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing in psychiatry remains modest, in part due to divergent perceptions of the quality and completeness of the evidence base and diverse perspectives on the clinical utility of PGx testing among psychiatrists and other healthcare providers. Recognizing the current lack of consensus within the field, the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics assembled a group of experts to conduct a narrative synthesis of the PGx literature, prescribing guidelines, and product labels related to psychotropic medications as well as the key considerations and limitations related to the use of PGx testing in psychiatry. The group concluded that to inform medication selection and dosing of several commonly-used antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, current published evidence, prescribing guidelines, and product labels support the use of PGx testing for 2 cytochrome P450 genes (\emph{CYP2D6, CYP2C19}). In addition, the evidence supports testing for human leukocyte antigen genes when using the mood stabilizers carbamazepine (\emph{HLA-A and HLA-B}), oxcarbazepine (\emph{HLA-B}), and phenytoin (CYP2C9, HLA-B). For valproate, screening for variants in certain genes (\emph{POLG, OTC, CSP1}) is recommended when a mitochondrial disorder or a urea cycle disorder is suspected. Although barriers to implementing PGx testing remain to be fully resolved, the current trajectory of discovery and innovation in the field suggests these barriers will be overcome and testing will become an important tool in psychiatry.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Both genes' genotypes are translated into predicted normal metabolizer (NM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM). Evidence-based dose recommendations were obtained, based on a structured analysis of published literature. In CYP2C19 PM patients, escitalopram dose should not exceed 50\% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 75\% of the normal maximum dose. Escitalopram should be avoided in UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, citalopram dose should not exceed 50\% of the normal maximum dose. In CYP2C19 IM patients, this is 70\% (65--75\%) of the normal maximum dose. In contrast to escitalopram, no action is needed for CYP2C19 UM patients. In CYP2C19 PM patients, sertraline dose should not exceed 37.5\% of the normal maximum dose. No action is needed for CYP2C19 IM and UM patients. In CYP2D6 UM patients, paroxetine should be avoided. No action is needed for CYP2D6 PM and IM patients. In addition, no action is needed for the other gene-drug combinations. Clinical effects (increase in adverse events or decrease in efficacy) were lacking for these other gene-drug combinations. DPWG classifies CYP2C19 genotyping before the start of escitalopram, citalopram, and sertraline, and CYP2D6 genotyping before the start of paroxetine as ``potentially beneficial'' for toxicity/effectivity predictions. This indicates that genotyping prior to treatment can be considered on an individual patient basis.},

Given the potential implications of these outcomes and recent proliferation of PGx studies, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of PGx testing on clinical outcomes in patients with MDD as compared to treatment as usual (TAU). MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and CENTRAL were searched for English-language articles from 2000 to 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGx-guided treatment vs. TAU in patients with MDD. Meta-analyses were conducted in R. Ten RCTs were included: eight reported remission and seven reported response. The best available evidence suggests that PGx-guided care for moderate-to-severe adult depression is more likely to result in remission and response than TAU (both risk ratios significant). However, there are limitations in the evidence base, including high risk of bias and inconsistency between trials. Despite the consequent very low certainty in the magnitude of effect, there is confidence in the direction. Though modest, the beneficial effects of PGx for adults with moderate-severe MDD could - as a result of the scope and scale of the condition and its impacts - have important ramifications for patients and the health system.},

  abstract = {Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used in the treatment of several psychiatric disorders, including major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bulimia. Amitriptyline also has different off-label uses, including migraine prevention, neuropathic pain management, fibromyalgia, and enuresis (bedwetting) (1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) primarily mediate their therapeutic effect by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, leaving more neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft stimulating the neuron. Given that the tricyclics can also block different receptors (H1 histamine, {$\alpha$}1-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors), side effects are common. As such, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have largely replaced the use of TCAs; however, TCAs still have an important use in specific types of depression and other conditions. Amitriptyline is metabolized mainly via CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 pathways. Metabolism by CYP2C19 results in active metabolites, including nortriptyline, which is also a tricyclic antidepressant. Metabolism catalyzed by CYP2D6 results in the formation of the less active 10-hydroxy metabolite. Both the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes are highly polymorphic, resulting in proteins with different enzyme activity or expression levels. Individuals who are CYP2D6 ``ultrarapid metabolizers'' (UM) have more than 2 normal function alleles (multiple copies), whereas CYP2C19 UM have 2 increased function alleles. Individuals who are CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 ``poor metabolizers'' (PM) have 2 no function alleles for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19. The FDA-approved drug label for amitriptyline states that CYP2D6 PM have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants when given usual doses. The FDA recommendations also include monitoring tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels whenever a tricyclic antidepressant is co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Table 1) (1). The Dutch Pharmacogenetic Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal Dutch Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) have issued recommendations for altered dosing based on CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype (Table 2) (2, 3). Individuals who are CYP2D6 UM may require up to 1.6 times the normal dose, though cardiac toxicity risk may indicate use of an antidepressant that is less dependent upon CYP2D6 metabolism, such as citalopram or sertraline. Dose reductions are recommended for CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer (IM) individuals (75\% of normal dose) and CYP2D6 PM individuals (60\% of normal dose), along with monitoring for side effects and plasma drug levels. (3). The DPWG does not recommend any changes in dosing based on CYP2C19 metabolizer status, since the combined dose of amitriptyline and the active metabolite nortriptyline are not significantly impacted. (2) In 2016, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) published dosing recommendations for tricyclic antidepressants based on CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 metabolizer status, either individually or in combination (Table 3, Table 4) (4). For CYP2D6 UM, CPIC recommends avoiding the use of a tricyclic due to the potential lack of efficacy, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2D6. If a TCA is still warranted, CPIC recommends considering titrating the TCA to a higher target dose (compared with CYP2D6 normal metabolizers, ``NM'') and using therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dose adjustments. For CYP2D6 IM, CPIC recommends considering a 25\% reduction of the starting dose, and for CYP2D6 PM, to avoid the use of tricyclics because of the potential for side effects. If a tricyclic is still warranted for CYP2D6 PM, CPIC recommends considering a 50\% reduction of the starting dose while monitoring drug plasma concentrations to avoid side effects. For CYP2C19 UM, CPIC recommends avoiding the use of tertiary amines (for example, amitriptyline) due to the potential for a sub-optimal response, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19, such as the secondary amines nortriptyline or desipramine. For CYP2C19 PMs, CPIC recommends avoiding tertiary amine use due to the potential for sub-optimal response, and to consider an alternative drug not metabolized by CYP2C19. If a tertiary amine is still warranted for CYP2C19 PMs, CPIC recommends considering a 50\% reduction of the starting dose while monitoring drug plasma concentrations to avoid side effects (4). For gene-based dosing of TCAs for neuropathic pain, where the initial doses are lower, CPIC does not recommend dose modifications for PMs or IMs (either CYP2D6 or CYP2C19). For CYP2D6 UM individuals, CPIC optionally recommends considering an alternative medication due to a higher risk of therapeutic failure of TCAs for neuropathic pain (4).},

  abstract = {Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) reduces affected patients' quality of life and leads to important social health care costs. Pharmacogenomics-guided treatment (PGT) may be effective in the cure of TRD. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical changes after PGT in patients with TRD (two or more recent failed psychopharmacological trials) affected by bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to a control group with treatment as usual (TAU). We based the PGT on assessing different gene polymorphisms involved in the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs. We analyzed, with a repeated-measure ANOVA, the changes between the baseline and a 6 month follow-up of the efficacy index assessed through the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, and depressive symptoms through the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). The PGT sample included 53 patients (26 BD and 27 MDD), and the TAU group included 52 patients (31 BD and 21 MDD). We found a significant within-subject effect of treatment time on symptoms and efficacy index for the whole sample, with significant improvements in the efficacy index (F = 8.544; partial {$\eta^2$} = 0.077, p {$<$} 0.004) and clinical global impression of severity of illness (F = 6.818; partial {$\eta^2$} = 0.062, p {$<$} 0.01) in the PGT vs. the TAU group. We also found a significantly better follow-up response ({$\chi^2$} = 5.479; p = 0.019) and remission ({$\chi^2$} = 10.351; p = 0.001) rates in the PGT vs. the TAU group. PGT may be an important option for the long-term treatment of patients with TRD affected by mood disorders, providing information that can better define drug treatment strategies and increase therapeutic improvement.},

  abstract = {BackgroundIn patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), achieving remission and/or response may take many months because of the lengthy trial-and-error process often needed to identify effective medication. Pharmacogenomic testing is a prescribing tool that has been shown to improve remission and response rates for MDD patients, but data describing its impact over time is limited. The objective of this study was to determine whether pharmacogenomic-guided treatment increases the rate of remission and response over time in patients with MDD, and if so, to assess the persistence of that effect.MethodsThis study was a prespecified post hoc analysis of the PRIME Care (Precision Medicine in Mental Healthcare) randomized clinical trial, a pragmatic trial that compared pharmacogenomic-guided treatment with usual care among veterans with depression. Participants were recruited at 22 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers by 676 clinicians and were randomized to the pharmacogenomic-guided arm or the usual care arm. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between study arm (pharmacogenomic-guided treatment or usual care) and the first instance of response or remission as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale.Results1,764 (90.7\%) of the 1,944 veterans who participated in the PRIME Care trial had sufficient visit data to be included in this analysis. Patients who received pharmacogenomic-guided treatment had higher rates of remission (HR [95\% CI] = 1.27 [1.05, 1.53]; p = 0.015) and response (HR [95\% CI] = 1.21 [1.05, 1.40]; p = 0.010) at any time relative to patients receiving usual care. Schoenfeld residuals tests were not statistically significant for remission (p = 0.931) or response (p = 0.112), providing no evidence that the benefit due to pharmacogenomic-guided treatment changed over the 24-week period.ConclusionPharmacogenomic-guided treatment led to faster initial remission and response in patients with MDD, and this benefit persisted over 6 months with no evidence of changing over time.},

Evidence is presented for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotype-directed dosing of TCAs. This document is an update to the 2012 Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 Genotypes and Dosing of Tricyclic Antidepressants.},

  abstract = {Escitalopram, the (S)-enantiomer of citalopram,~is a highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Escitalopram is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating major depressive disorder (unipolar) in adults and adolescents (ages 12 to 17) for both acute and maintenance phases. The FDA recently approved escitalopram for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in both adults and children aged 7 and older. Escitalopram is also used off-label for conditions such as social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and the management of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Safe and effective treatment of escitalopram requires an understanding of its potential adverse effects and drug interactions.~This activity outlines the clinical applications, mechanisms of action, possible adverse effects, and drug interactions of escitalopram to help interprofessional~healthcare providers direct patient therapy in treating various conditions. This activity~also emphasizes the importance of vigilant monitoring and making informed decisions by healthcare professionals throughout escitalopram therapy, facilitating early detection and intervention to~ensure patient safety and provide optimal care.},

  abstract = {Pharmacogenetics (PGx) holds promise to help optimize the use of psychotropic medications, with CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 emerging as clinically relevant genes in antidepressant treatment. However, there are currently very few studies investigating the genetic variants of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in a population of patients experiencing either ineffectiveness or adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antidepressants in real-world settings, i.e., longitudinally regardless of the treatment indication.In our psychiatry department, PGx testing is now available in clinical practice to help with prescribing antidepressants properly, predicting the right dose and improving treatment outcomes. We present a case series involving 40 patients (82.5\% of European origin) who underwent PGx testing due to ineffectiveness or ADRs to antidepressant treatment between June 2020 and April 2022. We describe their demographic, clinical and genetic features and we have assessed the value of PGx testing by consulting the treating psychiatrists.Among the 40 patients, the most common primary diagnoses were major depressive disorder (60.0\%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (30.0\%). Ineffectiveness alone was reported by 26 patients (65.0\%), 1 patient (2.5\%) reported only ADRs while 13 (32.5\%) reported both ADRs and ineffectiveness. Antidepressant classes represented in this study were SSRIs (45.0\%), SNRIs (27.5\%), atypical antidepressants (20.0\%) and tricyclic antidepressants (17.5\%). Only 7 out of 40 patients (17.5\%) had normal metabolic activity for CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.We identified 50 CYP2D6/CYP2C19-antidepressant-response pairs, deemed 'actionable' if the CYP phenotypes potentially contributed to the observed response. We found actionability in 11.5\% of CYP2D6-antidepressant-response pairs and 33.3\% of CYP2C19-antidepressant-response pairs. In our cohort, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes were actionable for a total of 22.0\% pairs. The PGx algorithm recommendations were followed in 92.7\% of cases. According to practitioners, 71.4\% of patients showed a considerable decrease ({$\geq$} 3/5) of ADRs and 79.5\% showed a considerable improvement in efficacy ({$\geq$} 3/5).Although the limited sample size invites caution, our findings suggest that patients experiencing ADRs or ineffectiveness to antidepressants exhibit a relatively high prevalence of genetic variants in pharmacogenes known to influence the pharmacokinetics of these medications. The widespread adoption of targeted use of PGx testing in Psychiatry departments could prove beneficial in guiding prescribing decisions.},
