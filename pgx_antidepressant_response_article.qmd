# Introduction

## Context and Background

Genetics plays a foundational role in modern medicine by explaining why individuals differ in their susceptibility to disease and in their responses to therapeutic interventions. These genetic differences, combined with environmental and lifestyle factors, contribute to the wide variation observed in drug effectiveness and safety across patient populations. Precision medicine is an emerging approach that aims to optimize patient care by accounting for individual variability rather than applying uniform, standardized treatment strategies. It incorporates multiple sources of variation including genetic makeup, environmental exposures, and lifestyle components to support more accurate diagnoses and more precisely targeted therapies. By moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all model, precision medicine seeks to improve overall treatment outcomes and reduce the likelihood of therapeutic failure [@konigWhatPrecisionMedicine2017].

Pharmacogenetics represents a core branch of precision medicine focused on genome-level investigation to identify genetic variants that influence drug response. These variations can affect critical pharmacological processes such as drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, target interaction, and involvement in disease pathways. By making clear how genetic differences shape individual drug responses, pharmacogenetics provides the scientific basis for tailoring medication selection and dosing to each patient [@ingelman-sundbergPharmacogeneticsOpportunitySafer2001].

Treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remains challenging because initial antidepressant response rates are low and vary widely among patients. MDD is often underdiagnosed, complicated by somatic symptoms, and commonly co-occurs with chronic medical conditions, delaying accurate treatment. Even with proper diagnosis, many patients do not respond to first-line therapy, STAR*D data indicate that about $30\%$ of individuals fail to achieve remission after multiple antidepressant trials, highlighting a considerable treatment-resistant group [@rushSTARDRevisingConventional2009]. These outcomes reflect the biological and social heterogeneity of MDD, making standardized, trial-and-error prescribing inadequate. This gap underscores the need for more individualized strategies such as pharmacogenomic-guided therapy to optimize initial drug selection and reduce repeated treatment failures. 

## Scope and Thesis

This review examines the clinical role of pharmacogenomics (PGx) in guiding antidepressant prescribing, with a particular emphasis on its potential to improve treatment selection and patient outcomes. The central argument of this paper is that pharmacogenomic testing of key Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, can significantly enhance the prediction of drug response and optimize therapeutic outcomes for individuals undergoing antidepressant therapy.

# Materials & Methods

## Literature Search Strategy

To gather the materials for this review, our team conducted a literature search across several major scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. We used a range of search terms related to the topic, such as “pharmacogenomics and antidepressants,” “*CYP2D6*/*CYP2C19* polymorphisms,” “*CYP2D6* and *CYP2C19* dose adjustments,” “major depressive disorder (MDD),” “drug metabolism genetics,” and “precision medicine,” “CPIC guidelines,” “DPWG guidelines,” “tricyclic antidepressants,” and “SSRIs.” These articles were selected based on the following criteria: peer-reviewed publications, clinical guidelines, and review papers published between 2000 and 2025, with a clear focus on pharmacogenomics and antidepressant therapy. Sources that were not peer-reviewed such as conference abstracts, opinion pieces, Wikipedia, or studies unrelated to antidepressant medications were excluded to ensure the review was based on reliable and clinically relevant evidence.

## Data Extraction and Synthesis

We extracted and synthesized data from the selected sources, focusing on key pharmacogenomic elements such as the specific genes involved (e.g., *CYP2D6*, *CYP2C19*), the corresponding antidepressant drug classes (e.g., SSRIs, TCAs), and the predicted metabolic phenotypes including ultrarapid, normal, intermediate, and poor metabolizers. Clinical recommendations from CPIC and the DPWG were also collected, along with comparative findings evaluating treatment-as-usual (TAU) versus PGx-guided antidepressant therapy in patients with MDD.

After extraction, the information was systematically synthesized and organized into three central thematic categories: Genetics in Etiology and Diagnosis, Applications in Therapy, and Clinical Challenges and Future Directions. This structure provides a coherent framework that guides the development of the Discussion section and enables clear integration of the evidence across studies.

## Application in Therapy

PGx testing directly translates genetic data into evidence-based clinical decisions, which fundamentally alters the traditional trial-and-error approach to antidepressant therapy. By utilizing genetic data, clinicians can optimize treatment efficacy and safety with informed drug selections and precise dosage adjustments.

### Guiding Drug Selection

The primary application of PGx in antidepressant therapy is the initial selection of a medication that matches the patient's metabolic profile. This process aims to maximize efficacy while alleviating the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) and the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) provide guidelines for specific gene-drug pairs, particularly involving *CYP2D6* and *CYP2C19* [@bousmanClinicalPharmacogeneticsImplementation2023; @bousmanReviewConsensusPharmacogenomic2021; @brouwerDutchPharmacogeneticsWorking2022].

*CYP2D6* Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UMs) possess multiple active copies of the gene, resulting in significantly elevated enzyme activity. Studies have found that *CYP2D6* gene duplications are most prevalent in Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia, with $20-30\%$ of the local population possessing this genotype (see Fig. \ref{fig:cyp2d6-distribution}). [**2 cái Tables này chuyển lên phần III. A. Genetics in Etiology and Diagnosis**]. For context, Table \ref{tab:tbl-cyp2d6-phenotype} and Table \ref{tab:tbl-cyp2c19-phenotype} show the assignment of likely phenotypes based on the diplotypes of the *CYP2D6* and *CYP2C19* genes, respectively. If these patients are prescribed Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) like amitriptyline or nortriptyline, the drug would be metabolized and cleared from the body too quickly to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations [@AmitriptylineResponseNIH]. Thus, standard treatments often have increased risk of failure. In such cases, guidelines recommend selecting an alternative antidepressant that is not primarily metabolized by *CYP2D6* to ensure the patient receives a therapeutic benefit [@deanAmitriptylineTherapyCYP2D62012]. Similarly, for *CYP2C19* UMs, guidelines suggest avoiding citalopram or escitalopram due to the high likelihood of subtherapeutic drug levels and treatment failure [@brouwerDutchPharmacogeneticsWorking2022].

### Dosage Adjustment
When a specific antidepressant is deemed necessary regardless of a non-normal metabolic status, PGx testing helps determine precise dosage adjustments to maintain safety and efficacy. Standard dosing is typically derived from population averages, which may be dangerous for Poor Metabolizers (PMs) or ineffective for UMs. CPIC guidelines offer specific dosing protocols based on genotype-predicted phenotypes:

- Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs): For *CYP2C19* PMs, CPIC recommends a $50\%$ reduction in the starting dose of citalopram, escitalopram, or sertraline [@bousmanClinicalPharmacogeneticsImplementation2023]. This reduction prevents the accumulation of the drug in the bloodstream, which could lead to dose-dependent side effects such as QT-interval prolongation (a heart rhythm disorder) or serotonin syndrome [@brouwerDutchPharmacogeneticsWorking2022; @landyEscitalopram2025].

- Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs): For *CYP2D6* PMs, a dose reduction of up to $50\%$ is recommended for drugs like paroxetine and most TCAs to avoid toxicity. Similarly, Intermediate Metabolizers (IMs) may require a moderate dose reduction (e.g., $25\%$) to balance efficacy and tolerability [@hicksClinicalPharmacogeneticsImplementation2017].

These adjustments allow clinicians to achieve steady-state drug concentrations that fall within the therapeutic window, thereby reducing the time patients spend on ineffective or toxic regimens [@althagafiIMPACTPHARMACOGENOMICSPERSONALIZED2022].

### Treatment of Resistant Cases

PGx is a critical tool for managing Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), which is defined as failure to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressants [@delcasalePharmacogenomicsGuidedPharmacotherapyPatients2022]. In clinical practice, PGx testing is often reserved for patients who have already failed multiple lines of therapy or experienced severe side effects.

Genetic testing can retrospectively explain treatment failure. For instance, a patient labeled "treatment-resistant" may actually be a *CYP2D6* UM who never achieved adequate serum levels of the prescribed medication, or a PM who discontinued therapy due to severe intolerance interpreted as non-compliance [@breilNonresponseConsecutiveAntidepressant2008; @lorvellecPharmacogeneticsTestingPoor2024]. Studies indicate that PGx-guided treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) significantly improves response and remission rates compared to treatment as usual (TAU) [@albersMetaanalysisResponseRemission2025; @hainPersistentBenefitPharmacogenomic2025; @bunkaEvaluatingTreatmentOutcomes2023]. By identifying the biological drivers of poor response, clinicians can switch to drugs with different metabolic pathways or mechanisms of action, thus overcoming the barrier of resistance.

## Clinical Challenges and Future Directions

### Challenges

High costs of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing represent a primary barrier to implementation in antidepressant therapy, with multi-gene panels often exceeding affordable thresholds in resource-limited settings and lacking consistent reimbursement from insurers. Physician education gaps persist, as many clinicians report insufficient training to interpret PGx results or integrate them into prescribing decisions, resulting in low adoption rates despite available guidelines. The complexity of multi-gene interpretation further complicates use, since antidepressant response involves interacting variants in genes like *CYP2D6* and *CYP2C19*, where phenotypes such as ultrarapid (UM) or poor metabolizers (PM) require nuanced assessment amid variable evidence strength. Additional obstacles include workflow disruptions, inconsistent clinical guidelines, and data privacy issues that hinder routine PGx application.​

## Future Directions

Future directions in PGx for antidepressant therapy aim to resolve key clinical challenges, such as interpretation complexity, physician education deficits, and workflow inefficiencies, through technological and analytical advancements. Integration of PGx data into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enables automated clinical decision support; for instance, the system scans a patient's genotype and alerts physicians if they are a *CYP2D6* UM, recommending a higher starting dose of antidepressants like nortriptyline to avoid subtherapeutic levels, or a PM status prompting dose reduction to prevent toxicity. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) will enhance precision by combining multiple loci to predict treatment response, surpassing single-gene limitations and supporting stratified dosing in depression care. These innovations, alongside expanded guidelines and training, promise broader equitable access.​
